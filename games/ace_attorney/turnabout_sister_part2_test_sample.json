            "ATTORNEY'S BADGE: No one would believe I was a defense attorney if I didn't carry this.. UI description: The evidence currently displayed is a circular, golden badge with a distinctive spiral or swirl pattern. It appears to be made of metal with a shiny, polished finish. The badge has a three-dimensional quality with ridges that create a sunburst or flower-like design radiating from the center. The center of the badge contains what looks like a stylized emblem or symbol. This is the standard attorney's badge worn by defense attorneys in the Ace Attorney universe, which serves as official identification in court. The badge is relatively small, designed to be worn on a lapel, and its distinctive design is immediately recognizable to those familiar with the legal profession in this game world.",
            "MIA'S AUTOPSY REPORT: Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.. UI description: The image shows a manila envelope or folder with what appears to be a few small dark spots or stains on its surface. The envelope is a light tan/beige color and has a rectangular shape with a slight fold or crease visible. It's displayed against a gray background in the evidence viewer. The envelope appears to be sealed or closed, and the dark spots could potentially be blood or some other substance relevant to the investigation. This piece of evidence is being examined in relation to Mia's case, and it likely contains the autopsy report mentioned in the header.",
            "MAYA'S CELL PHONE: Holds a conversation between the Chief and Maya. (September 5, 9:27 AM. Maya: Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while. Mia: Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me. Maya: Again? What is it this time? Mia: It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, 'The Thinker.' And it tells you the time! Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now. Maya: Huh? It's not working? That's lame! Mia: I had to take the clockwork out, sorry. I put some papers inside it instead. Maya: Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Mia: I'll leave that one up to your imagination. See you tonight at nine.). UI description: The image shows a pink/purple flip phone with a small rectangular screen on the top half. It has a standard numeric keypad with white buttons arranged in a grid pattern. The phone appears to be an older model cell phone (likely from the early 2000s) with an antenna at the top. There's a purple wrist strap attached to the bottom of the device. The phone is displayed against a gray background in the evidence viewer, and it's currently selected from the evidence menu at the bottom of the screen, which shows various other pieces of evidence including what appears to be a magatama, an envelope, footprints, a statue, and other items. The character dialogue at the bottom mentions something happening \"about 9:00,\" which may be relevant to the timing of a call or message stored on this phone.",
            "GLASS SHARDS: The broken remains of a glass light stand. Broken beyond all recognition.. UI description: The image shows several white, irregularly shaped fragments of broken glass displayed against a gray background. The shards appear to be thin and have jagged edges typical of shattered glass. The pieces vary in size and shape, with some being larger curved sections and others being smaller pointed fragments. These appear to be the remnants of what was once a glass light stand, though as noted in the description, they are broken to such an extent that the original form is no longer recognizable. The evidence is currently selected in the Court Record, highlighted with yellow borders in the evidence selection bar at the bottom of the screen.",
            "THE THINKER: The murder weapon. Looks like a statue, but it's actually a clock. Made by Larry Butz.. UI description: The image shows a small statue resembling Rodin's famous \"The Thinker\" sculpture. It appears to be a bronze or gold-colored figurine of a nude male figure sitting in a contemplative pose with his chin resting on his hand. The statue is mounted on what looks like a white or light gray pedestal/base with a small rectangular opening or slot visible on the front. The item is highlighted in the evidence menu at the bottom of the screen, indicating it's currently selected from the player's inventory of collected evidence items. The character in the game is mentioning something about the time being \"about 9:00,\" which may be relevant to this clock-statue's function in the case.",
            "WIRETAP: Found in Miss May's hotel room.. UI description: The image shows a small black electronic device with wires coming out of it. The device appears to be rectangular in shape with a smooth, dark surface. Two yellow-tipped wires extend from one end of the device. This appears to be a listening device or surveillance equipment commonly known as a wiretap. The device is relatively compact, likely designed to be hidden easily. It's currently highlighted in the evidence menu at the bottom of the screen, where other pieces of evidence are also visible, including what looks like a life preserver, an envelope, a cell phone, and several other items.",
            "RECEIPT: A department store receipt with letters written in blood on the back.. UI description: The image shows a small white piece of paper or receipt with the word \"Maya\" written on it in what appears to be red ink or blood. The writing is somewhat crude and uneven, with the letters clearly visible against the white background. There are also what look like small blood splatters or dots around the text. The receipt is displayed in the evidence viewer with a gray background, showing just the side with the \"Maya\" text visible. According to the case information, this is the back side of a department store receipt where the letters were written in blood, making this a potentially crucial piece of evidence in the current investigation.",
            "MAY TESTIMONY: \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\". UI description: The image shows what appears to be a white rectangular object with a folded or bent edge. It looks like a piece of chalk or possibly a stick of chalk in a simplified, line-drawn illustration style. The item is displayed in a gray box on the left side of the evidence screen. It has a long, slender shape with what seems to be a wrapper or covering partially opened at one end. The object appears to be something that could be held in one's hand and used for writing or marking.",
            "FLOOR PLANS: The murder scene, the Fey & Co. Law Offices.. UI description: The image shows a piece of evidence that appears to be a floor plan document. Visually, it's displayed as a light gray/white sheet of paper with what seems to be architectural drawings on it, though the specific details of the floor plan aren't clearly visible in the current view. The document would show the layout of the Fey & Co. Law Offices, which is identified as the murder scene in the case. The floor plan is likely an important piece of evidence that shows the spatial arrangement of the crime scene, which could be crucial for understanding how events unfolded during the murder. The document appears to be a standard architectural drawing that would show rooms, doorways, and possibly furniture placement within the law office."
