            "Mia: Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.",
            "Phoenix: Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.",
            "Mia: A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?",
            "Phoenix: Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.",

            "Phoenix: (Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)",
            "Phoenix: My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!",

            "Judge: ... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.",
            "Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)",
            "Judge: The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.",
            "Phoenix: The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.",
            "Judge: Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?",
            "Phoenix: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)",
            "Mia: Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?",
            "Phoenix: Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.",
            "Mia: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?",
            "Phoenix: Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.",
            "Judge: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?",
            "Phoenix: She was struck once, by a blunt object.",
            "Judge: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.",
            "Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)",
            "Judge: Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor?",
            "Judge: As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?",
            "Payne: The murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.",
            "Judge: I see... The court accepts it into evidence.",
            "Narration: Statue added to the Court Record.",
            "Mia: Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record frequently.",
            "Judge: Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.",
            "Payne: The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.",
            "Phoenix: Um, Chief, what do I do now?",
            "Mia: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)",
            "Payne: Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?",
            "Butz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!",
            "Phoenix: (Um... didn't they all die?)",
            "Butz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?",
            "Payne: Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!",
            "Butz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!",
            "Payne: Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.",
            "Narration: Passport added to the Court Record.",
            "Judge: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.",
            "Butz: Dude... no way...",
            "Payne: The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"",
            "Butz: Daddies? Sugar?",
            "Payne: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.",
            "Butz: Duuude!",
            "Payne: We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?",
            "Mia: Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.",
            "Phoenix: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)",
            "Butz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!",
            "Judge: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?",
            "Payne: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.",
            "Judge: Yes, quite.",
            "Phoenix: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)",
            "Payne: Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?",
            "Butz: Gulp!",
            "Payne: Well, did you, or did you not?",
            "Butz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)",
            "Judge: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?",
            "Payne: The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!",
            "Judge: Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor.",
            "Phoenix: (This is bad...)",
            "Payne: On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!",
            "Payne: Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?",
            "Sahwit: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!",
            "Judge: Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.",
            "Sahwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.",
            "Sahwit: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.",
            "Sahwit: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.",

            "Sahwit: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.",
            "Sahwit: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.",
            "Sahwit: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",

            "Phoenix: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)",
            "Judge: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?",
            "Payne: Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.",
            "Judge: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?",
            "Payne: Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.",

            "Phoenix: Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?",
            "Mia: Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!",
            "Phoenix: Lies! What?! He was lying!?",
            "Mia: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?",
            "Phoenix: !!! How do I prove he's not?",
            "Mia: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!",
            "Phoenix: Um... okay.",
