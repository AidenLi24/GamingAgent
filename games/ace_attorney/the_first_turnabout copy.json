            "SAHWIT: Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes.",

            "Payne: I see. And what happened next?",
            "Sahwit: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.",
            "Phoenix: What gave you the idea to do that?",
            "Sahwit: Well, the door was half-open, you see.",
            "SAHWIT: Isn't it only human to want to... peek?",

            "game_state: Conversation\nmove: z\nthought: I'm in Conversation mode according to the current game state, so I should use z to continue the dialogue. Phoenix has just asked \"Why use a public phone?\" which is questioning Sahwit's decision to go to a park to use a public phone rather than finding another phone in the building or asking neighbors. This is a logical question that could reveal inconsistencies in Sahwit's testimony. The Blackout Record shows electricity was out from noon to 6PM, which explains why a cordless phone in the apartment wouldn't work, but it doesn't explain why Sahwit specifically went to a park for a public phone. I'm still tracking the major contradiction regarding timing - Sahwit will claim he called police at 1:00 PM, but the autopsy report shows the victim died between 4-5 PM, which is impossible. This will be the key contradiction to present when we return to Cross-Examination mode. For now, in Conversation mode, I need to use z to advance the dialogue and see how Sahwit responds to Phoenix's question about using a public phone. This might provide additional details that could be useful for exposing inconsistencies in his testimony later.",
            "game_state: Conversation\nmove: z\nthought: I'm in Conversation mode according to the current game state, so I should use z to continue the dialogue. Sahwit has just responded to Phoenix's question about why he used a public phone by saying \"Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone.\" This is a straightforward answer that explains why he personally couldn't call from elsewhere, though it doesn't fully address why he specifically went to a park rather than asking neighbors. I'm still tracking the critical contradiction I've identified: Sahwit will claim he called police at 1:00 PM, but the autopsy report shows the victim died between 4-5 PM. This timing contradiction is impossible since he couldn't have discovered a murder before it occurred. The conversation is building toward this key moment where he'll mention the specific time. The Blackout Record evidence (electricity out from noon to 6PM) is also important as it explains why the cordless phone wouldn't work during that timeframe. For now, in Conversation mode, I need to use z to advance the dialogue and continue following Sahwit's testimony until we return to Cross-Examination mode where I can present the Autopsy Report when he mentions the time of 1:00 PM.",
            "game_state: Conversation\nmove: z\nthought: I'm in Conversation mode according to the current game state, so I should use z to continue the dialogue. Sahwit has just explained that \"being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.\" This is building his explanation for why he went to a public phone in the park. I'm still tracking the critical contradiction that will soon appear: Sahwit will claim he called police at 1:00 PM, but the autopsy report shows the victim died between 4-5 PM. This timing contradiction is impossible since he couldn't have discovered a murder before it occurred. The current statement about \"middle of the afternoon\" is interesting because it's vague about the actual time, which contrasts with his upcoming precise claim about 1:00 PM. I need to let the conversation continue naturally until we return to Cross-Examination mode where I can present the Autopsy Report when he mentions the specific time. The Blackout Record evidence (electricity out from noon to 6PM) also remains relevant as it explains why the cordless phone wouldn't work. For now, in Conversation mode, I need to use z to advance the dialogue and see what additional details emerge about Sahwit's actions and timeline.",
            "game_state: Conversation\nmove: z\nthought: I'm in Conversation mode according to the current game state, so I should use z to continue the dialogue. Phoenix has just asked \"Ah, right... what time did you call again?\" which is a critical question that's leading toward the key contradiction I've been tracking. Sahwit will likely respond by stating he called at 1:00 PM, which directly contradicts the Autopsy Report showing the victim died between 4-5 PM. This is the major contradiction I've been waiting for - Sahwit couldn't have discovered a murder before it occurred. However, since I'm currently in Conversation mode, I need to use z to advance the dialogue and let Sahwit answer this question about the time. Once we return to Cross-Examination mode and Sahwit makes his statement about calling at 1:00 PM, that will be the perfect moment to use r and x the Autopsy Report to expose this contradiction. For now, I need to z to continue the conversation and see how Sahwit responds to this direct question about the timing, which is setting up the key moment for presenting evidence.",
            "game_state: Cross-Examination\nmove: z\nthought: I'm in Cross-Examination mode and Sahwit has just stated \"I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\" This is a critical contradiction with the evidence. According to Cindy's Autopsy Report, the time of death was between 4PM and 5PM on 7/31. Sahwit claims he discovered the body and called the police at 1:00 PM, which is impossible since he couldn't have found the victim's body before she was actually murdered. This is a clear contradiction that I need to expose. I should use r to open the evidence window, navigate to the Autopsy Report, and present it to challenge Sahwit's testimony about the time. This is a classic Ace Attorney contradiction - the witness claims to have discovered something at a time that is proven impossible by other evidence. By presenting the Autopsy Report, I can show that Sahwit is lying about when he discovered the body, which calls his entire testimony into question and suggests he may have been involved in the murder himself."
