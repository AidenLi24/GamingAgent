            "Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.",
            "Phoenix: And did you find any evidence?",
            "Gumshoe: Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal.",
            "Gumshoe: Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!",
            "Phoenix: (I got a bad feeling about this...)",
            "Gumshoe: I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!",
            "Phoenix: Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!",
            "Gumshoe: Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?",
            "Phoenix: Wh-who? Um...",
            "Phoenix: Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!",
            "Gumshoe: Hoh.",
            "Gumshoe: You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!",
            "Phoenix: She was framed!",
            "Edgeworth: Hold on.",
            "Edgeworth: If that's the case, where's your evidence?",
            "Phoenix: Ah... (Urk!)",
            "Edgeworth: Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you.",
            "Edgeworth: Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.",
            "Gumshoe: Yeah, pal!",
            "Phoenix: (Argh...!)",
            "Edgeworth: Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.",
            "Gumshoe: On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!",
            "Phoenix: Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?",
            "Gumshoe: Of course I do, pal!",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)",
            "Gumshoe: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!",
            "Phoenix: What kind of \"tests\" were these again?",
            "Gumshoe: Huh? What kind? Umm... well...",
            "Gumshoe: I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl...",
            "Gumshoe: Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin...",
            "Gumshoe: I-I refuse to testify on this matter, pal!",
            "Gumshoe: I'm no expert on blood tests!",
            "Judge: Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.",
            "Gumshoe: Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.",
            "Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe.",
            "Gumshoe: Y-yeah?",
            "Edgeworth: I look forward to your next evaluation. As should you.",
            "Gumshoe: ...O-oh...",
            "Phoenix: (That was a mess...)",
            "Gumshoe: Right! Where was I?",
            "Gumshoe: Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!",
            "Phoenix: On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?",
            "Gumshoe: The right hand!",
            "Phoenix: (Hmm... she WAS right handed...)",
            "Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Nice try!",
            "Phoenix: (Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)",
            "Gumshoe: Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!",
            "Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe!",
            "Phoenix: Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?",
            "Gumshoe: Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!",
            "Phoenix: This isn't a movie, Detective.",
            "Gumshoe: Oof!",
            "Phoenix: Let's talk about reality, shall we?",
            "Gumshoe: Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.",
            "Phoenix: Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name?",
            "Phoenix: Especially the name of her own sister?",
            "Gumshoe: Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.",
            "Edgeworth: Stop right there.",
            "Edgeworth: The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant!",
            "Edgeworth: The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused...",
            "Edgeworth: The victim told us the name of her killer!",
            "Judge: Order! Order!",
            "Phoenix: (That didn't go so well...)",
            "Gumshoe: Th-that's right! What he said!",
            "Phoenix: (That's his whole testimony...)",
            "Phoenix: (Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)"

            "MAYA'S CELL PHONE: Holds a conversation between the Chief and Maya. (September 5, 9:27 AM. Maya: Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while. Mia: Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me. Maya: Again? What is it this time? Mia: It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, 'The Thinker.' And it tells you the time! Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now. Maya: Huh? It's not working? That's lame! Mia: I had to take the clockwork out, sorry. I put some papers inside it instead. Maya: Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Mia: I'll leave that one up to your imagination. See you tonight at nine.). UI description: An older model, non-flip cell phone, primarily purple or violet in color. It features a small, dark rectangular screen on the upper portion and a light grey keypad below with multiple small, rectangular buttons arranged in rows. A short antenna extends from the top right corner. A matching purple wrist strap, looped through a hole on the top left, hangs beside the phone.

The scene description confirms the evidence window is closed and no options are available. Pressing ('l') might yield more details, but given the previous exchanges where pressing on the note/blood was shut down by Edgeworth, and the lack of evidence, it's better to hear the rest of the testimony first.

The Court Record status says \"Total Evidence Collected: 0\". Even considering the items mentioned in the narrative (Floor Plans, Wiretap, Statue), none of them directly contradict this specific statement. Pressing this statement previously resulted in Edgeworth objecting. Since I have no contradictory evidence and pressing was unfruitful, and this appears to be the final statement in this segment of testimony (based on Phoenix's thought \"That's his whole testimony...\"), the correct action is to move to the next statement using 'z', which will loop back to the first statement of this testimony section, allowing me to re-examine everything.",
