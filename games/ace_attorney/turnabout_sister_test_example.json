        "Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.",
        "Phoenix: And did you find any evidence?",
        "Gumshoe: Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal.",
        "Gumshoe: Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!",
        "Phoenix: (I got a bad feeling about this...)",
        "Gumshoe: I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!",
        "Phoenix: Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!",
        "Gumshoe: Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?",
        "Phoenix: Wh-who? Um...",
        "Phoenix: Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!",
        "Gumshoe: Hoh.",
        "Gumshoe: You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!",
        "Phoenix: She was framed!",
        "Edgeworth: Hold on.",
        "Edgeworth: If that's the case, where's your evidence?",
        "Phoenix: Ah... (Urk!)",
        "Edgeworth: Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you.",
        "Edgeworth: Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.",
        "Gumshoe: Yeah, pal!",
        "Phoenix: (Argh...!)",
        "Edgeworth: Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.",
        "Gumshoe: On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!",
        "Phoenix: Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?",
        "Gumshoe: Of course I do, pal!",
        "Phoenix: (Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)",
        "Gumshoe: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!",
        "Phoenix: What kind of \"tests\" were these again?",
        "Gumshoe: Huh? What kind? Umm... well...",
        "Gumshoe: I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl...",
        "Gumshoe: Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin...",
        "Gumshoe: I-I refuse to testify on this matter, pal!",
        "Gumshoe: I'm no expert on blood tests!",
        "Judge: Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.",
        "Gumshoe: Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.",
        "Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe.",
        "Gumshoe: Y-yeah?",
        "Edgeworth: I look forward to your next evaluation. As should you.",
        "Gumshoe: ...O-oh...",
        "Phoenix: (That was a mess...)",
        "Gumshoe: Right! Where was I?",
        "Gumshoe: Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!",
        "Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe!",
        "Phoenix: There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here.",
        "Phoenix: You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note.",
        "Phoenix: That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey?",
        "Phoenix: That's really what you're saying?",
        "Gumshoe: Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it?",
        "Gumshoe: Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?",
        "Phoenix: You have it backwards, Detective.",
        "Gumshoe: B-backwards?",
        "Phoenix: The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it!",
        "Phoenix: This is a report from your department, Detective.",
        "Phoenix: \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\"",
        "Phoenix: She died immediately!",
        "Gumshoe: But...!",
        "Phoenix: No \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!",
        "Judge: Order! Order!",
        "Judge: The defense has a point.",
        "Judge: Someone who died immediately wouldn't have had the time to write anything down.",
        "Edgeworth: Mr. Wright.",
        "Edgeworth: I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?",
        "Phoenix: Wh-when...!?",
        "Phoenix: It was the day after the murder...",
        "Judge: The prosecution's point being...?",

        "Phoenix: Wh-what!?",
        "Edgeworth: A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request!",
        "Edgeworth: \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object...\"",
        "Edgeworth: \"But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\"",
        "Edgeworth: I received these results this morning.",
        "Phoenix: N-no way!",
        "Edgeworth: Your Honor!",
        "Edgeworth: It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"!",
        "Edgeworth: That is all.",
        "Judge: I see!",
        "Phoenix: (Damn you, Edgeworth!)",
        "Phoenix: (I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)",
        "Edgeworth: Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked!",
        "Edgeworth: Something you want to say?",
        "Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth...",
        "Phoenix: I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict...",
        "Phoenix: What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?",
        "Judge: Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!",
        "Edgeworth: No matter, Your Honor...",
        "Edgeworth: Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.",
        "Edgeworth: Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.",

        "Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor?",
        "Edgeworth: The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.",
        "Judge: I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.",
        "Phoenix: (Darn! This isn't good!)",
        "Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to call its next witness.",
        "Edgeworth: This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!",

        "April: Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee.",
        "April: I checked in right after lunch.",
        "Edgeworth: And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?",

        "SYSTEM: -- Witness's Account --",
        "April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!",
        "April: And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!",
        "April: The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!",
        "April: Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!",
        "April: But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!",
        "April: Then the woman with the long hair...",
        "April: She kinda... slumped.",
        "April: The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy!",
        "Judge: Hmm...",
        "Judge: I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony.",

        "Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright?",
        "Phoenix: What about my cross-examination!?",
        "Judge: I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?",
        "Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not?",
        "Edgeworth: You must know her techniques well.",
        "Edgeworth: Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...",
        "Phoenix: H-hey! How dare you!",
        "Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?",
        "Phoenix: I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination.",
        "Phoenix: (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to!)",
        "Phoenix: (She has to have some weakness!)",
        "Judge: Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!",
        "NONE: -- Witness's Account --",
        "Phoenix: Why did you do that?",
        "April: Huh? \"Why\"? Like, why what?",
        "Phoenix: Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?",
        "April: Oh, well, um... gee!",
        "Phoenix: (What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)",
        "April: I sort of, y'know.",
        "April: I had a feeling!",
        "Phoenix: (We",
        "Phoenix: (Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)",
        "Phoenix: (Let's see how far I can run with this...)",
        "Phoenix: Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!",
        "April: I... oooh!",
        "Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!",
        "Phoenix: B-badgering?",
        "Edgeworth: You insist on needling her with these trivial questions.",
        "Edgeworth: I really don't think it should be allowed.",

        "Phoenix: How did you know it was my client!?",
        "April: Huh? Well, I... gee!",
        "April: First of all, she had a girl's physique!",
        "April: And, and secondly, she was... she was small!",

        "April: Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!",
        "Phoenix: Okay...",
        "Phoenix: If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey...",
        "Phoenix: You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!",
        "April: ...!",
        "Phoenix: No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her!",
        "Phoenix: And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me!",
        "Phoenix: However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things!",
        "Phoenix: The testimony is bogus!",
        "April: But... but!",
        "Judge: Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...",

        "Judge: Please begin the cross-examination.",
