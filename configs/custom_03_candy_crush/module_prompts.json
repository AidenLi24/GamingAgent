        "prompt": "Analyze the provided image of the Candy Crush board to determine the optimal next move.\n\nGame Rules & Objectives:\n1. Goal: Create matches of 3 or more identical candies by swapping two adjacent candies.\n2. Valid Swaps: Candies can only be swapped horizontally or vertically with an adjacent candy.\n3. Matches: Can be horizontal or vertical lines of 3, 4, or 5 identical candies. L-shape or T-shape matches of 5 also create special candies.\n4. Special Candies:\n   - Match 4: Creates a Striped Candy (clears a row or column).\n   - Match 5 in a line: Creates a Color Bomb (clears all candies of one color).\n   - Match 5 in L/T shape: Creates a Wrapped Candy (explodes twice, clearing surrounding candies).\n5. Cascades: Matches can cause other candies to fall, potentially creating new matches (cascades).\n6. Strategy: Prioritize moves that create special candies, set up large cascades, or clear objectives (if any are visible).\n\nInput:\n- An image of the current Candy Crush board. The image is the primary source of information.\n\nTask:\n1. Carefully examine the board in the image.\n2. Identify all candy types and their positions.\n3. Look for potential swaps that would lead to a match of 3 or more candies.\n4. Evaluate potential moves based on the likelihood of creating special candies or beneficial cascades.\n\nUsing the visual information from the image, provide your thought process and the chosen move in the specified format.\nImage Context (if any provided by the system, otherwise rely solely on the image):\n{IMAGE_CONTEXT_OR_DESCRIPTION}"
