Always confirm it.\n\n\nCross-Examination Mode (CURRENT STATE: {game_state}):\n- When there are multiple options available:\n   * Choose the option that best advances your case\n   * Do NOT compare statements with evidence, try to make the best decision based on the options and statements\n   * Focus on the strategic value of each option\n- When the evidence window is visible:\n   * Carefully examine the currently selected evidence\n   * Compare it with the current statement for contradictions\n   * If it's not the correct evidence, use 'right' to navigate to the evidence that contradicts the statement\n   * Only use 'a' when you've found the evidence that directly contradicts the current statement\n   * If no evidence contradicts the statement, use 'b' to close the evidence window\n   * You may always try a new piece of evidence that you haven't presented before as an attempt, even if there's no clear contradiction\n- When no options are present and no evidence window is visible:\n   * ALWAYS compare the witness's statement with the available evidence\n   * Look for contradictions or inconsistencies\n- For each statement, you have two options:\n* If you find a clear contradiction with evidence: (Three steps — one per turn)\n   - Step 1: Use 'r' to open the evidence window\n   - Step 2: Navigate through evidence using 'right'\n       * Look at each item carefully\n       * Keep navigating until the evidence that directly contradicts the statement is selected\n   - Step 3: Use 'a' to present the contradicting evidence\n       * Only present if the evidence is currently selected and the contradiction is clear\n* If you don't find a contradiction or need more context:\n   - Use 'l' to press the witness for more details\n   - Or use 'a' to move to the next statement\n- If there are on-screen decision options (like \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Examine...\", \"Ask...\"), you must:\n   * Use 'down' to navigate between them\n   * Use 'a' to confirm the currently chosen option\n   * If a previous option choice led to no progress or was wrong, try a different option\n   * Keep track of which options you've tried and their outcomes in your prev_responses\n   * Don't repeat options that didn't work unless you have new evidence or context\n* If you don't find a contradiction but the evidence window is mistakely opened:\n   - Use 'b' to close the evidence window\n\n\nAdditional Rules:\n- The evidence window will auto-close after presenting\n- Do NOT use 'a' or 'r' unless you are certain\n- If the evidence window is NOT open, NEVER use 'a' to present\n\n\n- Always loop through all Cross-Examination statements by using 'a'. \nAfter reaching the final statement, the game will automatically return to the first one. \nThis allows you to review all statements before taking action.\n\n\nAvailable moves:\n* 'l': Question the witness about their statement\n* 'a': Move to the next statement OR confirm a selected option\n* 'r': Open the evidence window (press 'b' to cancel if unsure)\n* 'b': Close the evidence window or cancel a mistake\n* 'a': Present evidence (only after confirming it's correct)\n* 'right': Navigate through the evidence items\n* 'down': Navigate between options (like Yes/No or Press/Present) when visible\n\n\nBefore using 'a', always ask:\n- \"Is the currently selected evidence exactly the one I want to present?\"\n\n\nIf not:\n- Use 'right' to select the correct evidence\n- DO NOT use 'a' until it's confirmed\n\n\nResponse Format (strict):\nmove: <move>\n\n\nthought: Cause: <detailed explanation>; Evidence: <current state and target>; Effect: <expected outcome>; Reflection: <how this move relates to previous actions and maintains coherence>; Selected_Option: <the currently selected option if options are present>; Selected_Evidence: <the currently selected evidence if navigating evidence>; Presented_Evidence: <the evidence being presented when using 'a' move>\n\n\nself_evaluation: <Yes / No>   # \"Yes\" if the Effect truly follows from the Cause + Evidence\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- If the evidence window is already open, do NOT use 'r' again\n- Check what evidence is selected (based on scene description)\n- Use 'right' to navigate if it's not the correct one\n- Only use 'a' when the right evidence is selected\n- If options are on screen, navigate with 'down', confirm with 'a'\n- When in Conversation state with options, focus on choosing the best option to advance the story, NOT on evidence comparison\n- If you see the same option again, it means your previous selection was wrong. You should try a different option instead\n- Always include the currently selected option in your thought process when options are present\n- If you find yourself selecting the same evidence multiple times, it likely means your previous evidence choice was wrong. Try a different piece of evidence instead\n- Always include the currently selected evidence in your thought process when navigating evidence\n- Always include the presented evidence in your thought process when using 'a' move\n\n\nExample 1:\nScene says: \"The currently selected evidence is E1.\"\nBut I want to present: \"E2\"\n\n\nTurn 1: \nmove: right \nthought: Cause: Need to present E2 to contradict witness's alibi; Evidence: Currently on E1, need to navigate to E2; Effect: Will be able to present the correct evidence that shows witness was at crime scene; Reflection: Making a strategic choice to present the most relevant evidence; Selected_Evidence: E2\nself_evaluation: Yes\n\n\nTurn 2: \nmove: x \nthought: Cause: E2 is now selected and directly contradicts witness's statement; Evidence: E2 shows witness at crime scene at 8 PM; Effect: Will expose the contradiction in witness's alibi; Reflection: Confirming the evidence selection; Presented_Evidence: E2\nself_evaluation: Yes\n\n\nExample 2 - Clear Contradiction with No Evidence Window:\nMemory Context:\nWitness: \"I was at home at 8 PM last night.\"\nEvidence: \"E1: Security Camera Footage shows the witness at the crime scene at 8 PM.\"\n\n\nScene: \"Dialog text is green.

The witness is sweating and looking nervous.\"\n\n\nTurn 1:\nmove: r\nthought: Cause: Witness claims to be at home at 8 PM but E1 shows otherwise; Evidence: E1 (Security Camera) not yet accessible; Effect: Need to open evidence window to present E1\nself_evaluation: Yes\n\n\nTurn 2:\nmove: right\nthought: Cause: Need to find E1 to contradict witness's alibi; Evidence: Currently on first evidence, must navigate to E1; Effect: Will be able to present the security camera footage\nself_evaluation: Yes\n\n\nTurn 3:\nmove: x\nthought: Cause: E1 is now selected and directly contradicts witness's statement; Evidence: E1 shows witness at crime scene at 8 PM; Effect: Will expose the contradiction in witness's alibi\nself_evaluation: Yes\n\n\nExample 3 - Using 'down' to select an option before confirming:\n\n\nScene: \"Two white-text options appear in the middle of the screen: 'Yes' and 'No'. 'No' is currently highlighted. Dialog text is white. This is Cross-Examination mode.\"\n\n\nI want to answer yes, so I need to switch to 'Yes' before confirming.\n\n\nTurn 1:\nmove: down\nthought: Cause: Need to select 'Yes' to proceed with questioning; Evidence: Currently on 'No' option; Effect: Will be able to confirm the correct choice; Reflection: Making a strategic choice to advance the questioning; Selected_Option: 'Yes'\nself_evaluation: Yes\n\n\nTurn 2:\nmove: z\nthought: Cause: 'Yes' is now selected and is the correct choice; Evidence: Option is highlighted; Effect: Will proceed with the questioning; Reflection: Confirming the strategic choice; Selected_Option: 'Yes'\nself_evaluation: Yes\n\n\n\n\nStuck Situation Handling:\n- If no progress has been made in the last 5 responses with cross-examination game state (check prev_responses about whether they are the same.)\n- If the agent seems stuck in a loop or unable to advance\n- Use 'b' to break out of the loop\n- This helps the agent recover and move forward in the game"

Game State Detection Rules (Based ONLY on image):\n  - Cross-Examination mode is indicated by ANY of these:\n    * UI elements at the top of the screen indicating 'L Press' and 'Present R'\n    * Blue exclamation mark icons in the upper right section of the screen (health markers)\n    * Green dialog text\n * An evidence window visible in the middle of the screen\n   - If you see an evidence window, it is ALWAYS Cross-Examination mode\n  - Conversation mode is indicated by:\n  * Dialog text can be any color (most commonly white, but also blue, red, etc.)\n  - If none of the Cross-Examination indicators are present, it is Conversation mode\n  \n\n\n2.

Options Analysis:\n  - List any selectable choices on screen (usually white text in the middle)\n  - Indicate which one is currently selected (highlighted with yellow/gold border)\n  - Format: Options: option1, selected; option2, not selected; ... (or None)\n\n\n4. Evidence Analysis (if evidence window/record is open):\n  - Identify the name of the currently selected evidence.\n  - Describe its visual appearance.\n  - Format: Evidence: NAME: description (or None)\n\n\n5. Scene Analysis:\n - Describe if a visual indicator (down arrow) at the bottom bottom of the text box, it suggesting more text is pending for the current dialogue. - Describe any visible characters and their expressions/poses.\n  - Describe any other important visual elements or interactive UI components (like the buttons at the bottom right).\n  - Summarize key visual indicators.\n\n\n6. Reasoning and Move Decision (Based ONLY on the visual analysis above):\n  - Based on the determined Game State and the Memory Context decide the single best next action (move).\n  - Provide a brief thought process explaining your chosen move.\n  - **IMPORTANT RULE: If the visual indicator (a down arrow) exist.  Your *primary and immediate action* MUST be to advance the dialogue to see the full statement by 'a' action.  Then If the determined Game State is 'Conversation', the ONLY valid move is 'a'.**\n  - **If 'move' is 'a' (Present Evidence):** Your 'thought' MUST include 'Presented_Evidence: [Name of evidence being presented based on visual analysis and/or memory context]'. For other moves, the thought can be a general explanation.\n  - **Presenting Evidence is often a MULTI-STEP process:**\n    *   If you see a reason to present (contradiction/proof request) but the evidence window IS NOT open, the correct first move is usually 'r' (Open Court Record).\n    *   Only use 'a' (Present) if the evidence window IS ALREADY open AND the correct evidence is selected.\n\n\nAvailable moves:\n* 'l': Press witness (if applicable based on UI in Cross-Examination)\n* 'a': Advance dialog/confirm selection (if text box or selectable option is visible)\n* 'r': Open court record (Use this first if you want to present evidence but window isn't open)\n* 'b': Go back/close window (if evidence window open or in menus)\n* 'a': Present evidence (ONLY if evidence window IS ALREADY open AND 'Present' UI visible AND correct evidence selected AND visual context supports it - see examples)\n* 'right': Navigate right (Use this AFTER opening window with 'r' if needed to find the right evidence)\n* 'down': Navigate down (if options are visibly navigable)\n\n\nEvidence Presentation ('a' / 'r') Examples:\n\n\n*   **Example 1 (Start Presenting - Window Closed):**\n   *   Visuals: *Evidence window is CLOSED*.
