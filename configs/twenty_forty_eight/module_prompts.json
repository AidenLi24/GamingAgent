        "prompt": "2048 Game Quick Guide:\nPrimary Goal: Combine like tiles to create tiles with higher values.\nUltimate Goal: Create a tile with the value 2048 or higher.\n\nGame Mechanics:\n- The game is played on a 4x4 grid.\n- Each move (up, down, left, right) shifts all tiles in that direction.\n- Tiles with the same value that collide during a move combine into a single tile with twice the value.\n- After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell.\n- The game ends when there are no valid moves left.\n\nKey Strategies:\n1. Build a stable structure - Keep your highest value tiles in a corner.\n2. Maintain a clear path - Always have a direction where you can combine tiles.\n3. Chain reactions - Set up sequences of merges that can happen in a single move.\n4. Look ahead - Think about the consequences of your moves 2-3 steps ahead.\n5. Building patterns - Common patterns include:\n   - Snake/Zig-zag pattern: Arrange tiles in decreasing order in a zigzag.\n   - Corner anchoring: Keep the highest tile in a corner and build around it.\n\nAnalyze the following information to decide your next move:\n\n{context}\n\nBased on this combined information, what move should be taken next?",
