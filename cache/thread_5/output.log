[Thread 5 - SHORT] Python code to be executed:
import pyautogui
import time

# This appears to be a Super Mario game in a dark environment
# I can see what looks like a platform or level structure
# Since I can't clearly see Mario or immediate hazards, I'll take a cautious approach

# Press right arrow to move forward cautiously
pyautogui.keyDown('right')
time.sleep(0.5)
pyautogui.keyUp('right')

# Small jump to avoid any potential obstacles
pyautogui.keyDown('x')
pyautogui.keyDown('right')
time.sleep(0.2)
pyautogui.keyUp('x')
time.sleep(0.3)
pyautogui.keyUp('right')
